- [ ] ~~when `-H` does not specify the port it currently implies tcp/80~~
- [x] **CRITICAL** Alpine builds are broken
- [x] image tag is not working
- [x] container rename is not working
- [x] container rm not working anymore ?!?!
- [x] blacklist broken
- [x] blacklisted image should assume the latest tag when none is provided
- [x] `rmi` is not honouring the -f flag on images with containers
- [x] revisit `rm` for running containers
- [ ] restart -k does not restart all containers <-- _not reproduced yet_
- [ ] blacklist rm image not removing image from JSON if the `latest` tag is assumed
- [ ] `dtools clean` might not be working every time (why ?)
- [ ] `dtools prune` sometimes reports success when nothing was done
- [ ] long image pulls or pushes might time out.. Need to add an http timeout value
